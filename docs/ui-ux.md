# UI/UX

This document outlines the UI/UX aspects of the application.

## Pixel-Perfect Responsiveness

The application is designed to be responsive and uses media queries to adapt to different screen sizes. The `styles.css` file contains media queries for `max-width: 768px` and `max-width: 480px`. These media queries adjust the layout of the header, form, and other elements to provide an optimal viewing experience on tablets and mobile devices. For example, the form layout changes from a two-column grid to a single column on smaller screens.

## Intuitive Error Messages

The application provides intuitive error messages to guide the user in filling out the registration form correctly. The `script.js` file includes a `showValidationError` function that displays specific error messages next to the input fields that have validation errors. The `styles.css` file highlights the invalid input fields with a red border, providing a clear visual cue to the user.

## Smooth Transitions

The application uses CSS transitions to provide smooth visual feedback to the user. The `styles.css` file includes transitions for buttons and form controls. For example, buttons have a hover effect that changes their background color and adds a box shadow, and form controls have a focus effect that changes their border color and adds a box shadow. These transitions make the user interface feel more polished and interactive.
