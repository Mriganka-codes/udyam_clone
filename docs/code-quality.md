# Code Quality

This document outlines the code quality standards and practices.

## Clean Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend:

-   **Frontend:** The frontend code is located in `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`. It is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
-   **Backend:** The backend code is located in `index.js` and uses Express.js to provide a REST API. It is responsible for handling business logic, validation, and database interactions.
-   **Database:** The database schema is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma` and is managed using Prisma ORM.

This separation makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and scale.

## Modular Code

The code is well-modularized:

-   **Frontend:** The frontend JavaScript code in `script.js` is encapsulated within a `UdyamRegistrationForm` class. This class is responsible for managing the state and behavior of the registration form, which makes the code more organized and reusable.
-   **Backend:** The backend code in `index.js` is organized into middleware, validation rules, and API endpoints. This makes the code easy to read and understand. The use of Prisma for database access also contributes to the modularity of the code by abstracting away the database logic.

## Proper Comments

The codebase includes some comments, but there is room for improvement:

-   **Good:** The code includes comments that explain the purpose of some of the code blocks, such as the middleware and API endpoints in `index.js`.
-   **Needs Improvement:** The code could benefit from more detailed comments, especially for complex logic like the regular expressions used for validation. Some comments in `script.js` are outdated and should be removed or updated.

## Git Practices

It is not possible to assess the Git practices without access to the Git history of the project. However, some best practices to follow are:

-   **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes.
-   **Branching:** Use a branching strategy, such as GitFlow, to manage the development process.
-   **Pull Requests:** Use pull requests to review and discuss changes before merging them into the main branch.
